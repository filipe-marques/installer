This project is in ALPHA 1 state and this means that it needs testing and just installs Arch Linux
until the generation of fstab file and beyond that it needs your contribution and testing, because 
I don't know, if after executing in python 3 the command 'archroot (...) /bin/bash' , still 
executes the following commands.
